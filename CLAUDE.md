## Agent skills

### Issue tracker

Issues live in this repo's GitHub Issues, managed with the `gh` CLI. See `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`.

### Triage labels

The five canonical triage roles, used verbatim as label strings. See `docs/agents/triage-labels.md`.

### Domain docs

Single-context — `CONTEXT.md` and `docs/adr/` at the repo root. See `docs/agents/domain.md`.

### Testing policy

Which check a feature warrants — and whether it warrants one at all — is decided by the claim the
feature makes, not ad hoc per ticket. Six claims, six answers, and a content ticket names its check
kind explicitly so that "no check" is a recorded decision. See `docs/testing/what-to-check.md`.

### Worldgen check

`scripts/worldgen-check.py` launches a fresh world and asserts the loaded ore vein, bedrock
ore and worldgen layer registries against `tests/worldgen/expected.json`. A new body adds a
fixture entry, not code. See `docs/testing/worldgen-registry-check.md`.

### Flora data check

`tests/flora/test_flora_data.py` asserts Sapros's tree and surface data are internally consistent
— features, loot tables, blockstates, textures and lang against what is actually registered, plus
which marshland carries which tree and that no stromatolite drops ore — with no game launch. Run it
after any edit to the trees, the stromatolites or the five biomes.

### First-party mod

`planetaryfactory_core` is a Gradle subproject in `mod/`, built from the repo root with
`./gradlew :planetaryfactory_core:installToPack` — required after a fresh clone, since the jar
lands in the gitignored `mods/`. It owns mechanism only; ADR-0015 has the ownership table for
what goes in the mod, in KubeJS and in datapack JSON. See `mod/README.md`.
